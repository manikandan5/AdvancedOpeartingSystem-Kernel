Written comparison of the sizes requested in the exercise. Please elaborate on the reason behind the difference

Below you can see the memory list prior to the custom stack allocation where we assign the block which has the smallest difference between the size of the block and the size which needs to be allocated.

xsh $ freemem
Block address  Length of Block
-------------  ---------------
Memory Block : -2130600532      Length of Block : -214496 
Assigned 100 bytes
Memory Block : -2130600532      Length of Block : -214704 
Assigned 200 bytes
Memory Block : -2130600532      Length of Block : -215104 
Assigned 500 bytes
Memory Block : -2130600532      Length of Block : -216112 
Freed  500 bytes
Memory Block : -2130600532      Length of Block : -216112

Post calling a process, we are able to assign the stack as shown above. It can seen that 500 bytes are allocated, so the memory from last block gets assigned where as if we has used xinu stack allocation then the block would be allocated from the second last block.
