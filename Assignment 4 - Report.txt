All the producer functionalities like future_prod.c, future_set.c, future_alloc.c and future.h was developed by 
Manikandan Murugesan.

future.h holds the code for the future datastructure and future_alloc.c allocates memory to empty future.

In future_prod.c, the code to produce a value and saving into the future datastructure based on the state of the future is done.
If the future is in VALID state already, then the producer cannot produce a new value into the future. The setting of the value 
part is taken care by the code in future_set.c 

The consumer side code was implemented by Abhishek Mehra which are done in the files future_cons.c, future_gets.c, future_free.c
and xsh_prodcons.h

The consumer consumes the value produced by the producer based on the state of the future and the code for that is implemented
in future_cons.c and future_get.c

The code in future_free.c frees the memory allotted to the future
