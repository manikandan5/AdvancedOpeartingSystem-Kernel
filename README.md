# Advanced Opearting System-Kernel

This code was written for the course Advanced Operating Systems (CSCI-P 536) at Indiana University handled by Professor Martin Swany. Skeleton code was provided by the Professor to get us started with the assignment.

I implemented process synchronization, basic memory management, networking and simple file systems on top of the XINU OS code provided.
