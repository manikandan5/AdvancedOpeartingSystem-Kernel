01)     Two processes are allowed to work simultaneously in a mutually exclusive manner which implements synchronization. 
Both processes work in such a way that the resources they are sharing gets accessed by only of them at a time. The above 
mentioned concept is achieved, by process 1 waiting while process 2 accesses the resource and makes the required changes, 
and then it removes it hold, allowing process 1 to access the resource. Thus by using semaphores we ensure that each value 
being produced is being consumed and there is a complete synchronization between the two processes. This solves the problem 
of producer consumer faced earlier.

02)     A single semaphore cannot be used by both producer and consumer.  In a scenario when the consumer is called prior to 
the producer, in that case the wait function will be called and there will be no synchoronisation between the producer and 
the consumer. Hence we need two semaphores to make the synchoronisation work between the producer and the consumer.
